# Lashas-checkers
My first JavaScript checkers game

This repository showcases my first-ever project as a programmer: a functional checkers game implemented in JavaScript. Inspired by the events during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, I've designed the game using the colors of the Ukrainian flag to express my support. Despite some mistakes and room for optimization, it represents a significant milestone in my programming journey. Experience the classic checkers gameplay and witness the progress I've made since starting out. I have other diverse and complex projects on my GitHub account that demonstrate my programming experience. Feel free to explore and follow my journey as a developer.
